                    <p class="text-justify">As with most behaviour, the differences between similar species is caused by the initial evolution of the species.  Regardless of their environment horses have evolved in herds.  Horses use home ranges which they do not defend from other bands of horses.  Donkeys however have two possible social structures depending upon their environment.  In a nutritionally rich environment donkeys do establish herds; these groups may be slightly more transient than horse herds and jacks may be more territorial.  However, if the donkeys’ environment has limited vegetation and reduced water availability then mares spend much time on their own or with a previous year’s offspring, only congregating in larger brands in the non breeding season.  During the breeding season, in order to breed successfully, donkey stallions defend a territory from other stallions.  The behavioural differences between donkeys and horses may be the result of these different social structures.

                        For horses, out-running the slowest herd member ensures survival.  Solitary donkeys have no benefit from safety in numbers, and this may have lead to donkeys developing more of a fight mechanism.  Such is the strength of their fight mechanism that some donkeys can be used as guard animals for herds of sheep and goats against canine predators.



                        The tendency for donkey stallions to be territorial also leads to differences in their behaviour in domestication.  Donkeys can become territorial over their pasture and will sometimes attack small livestock and pets.  This territorial aggressive behaviour, it is most likely to occur in young male donkeys especially in the springtime or when their environment provides little mental stimulation.  However, older donkeys both male and female could display this behaviour.  Not all donkeys exhibit this type of behaviour and some are happy to live with small domestic livestock.

                        Donkeys are extremely stoical, and show their pain or fear much less than horses.  They are so stoical that even in cases of severe illness often the only symptom to alert the handler is very minor changes of behaviour.  Donkeys are less expressive in their behaviour when terrified and have a reduced flight mechanism so they tend not to panic as easily as horses.  This can lead to a misreading of their emotional states, and can, as a result, make them more difficult to work with than horses.  The fearful horse clearly displays their fear, the fearful donkey may simply raise himself up a couple of inches in height, his eyes may widen slightly and may just show what appears to be increased interest in the situation.  It is equally as easy to misdiagnose the bargey donkey, as being aggressive or disrespectful when in fact this behaviour is commonly found in donkeys that are actually fearful of their situation.</p>

                    <h3>Primary Species</h3>
                    <p class="text-justify">Mammoth Donkeys
The Mammoth donkey is a descendant of the Poitou, Maltese, Catalonian and Andalusia breeds. The Mammoth donkey, as its name suggests, is large and was bred to be a working animal. To be classified as a Mammoth donkey the male must be 58 inches and the female must be at least 56 inches.

Poitou Donkeys
Many people have not heard of the Poitou donkey as it is one of the rarest breeds and is slowly growing again in population after being named an endangered species. Since the Poitou was never used as a working animal and due to the breed's disposition it has slowly dwindled in numbers. The Poitou is the largest of the donkey breeds and is distinguishable due to its shaggy coat.

Standard Donkey
Most of the Donkeys now owned are usually classified according to their size. Due to their cross breeding tdhe standar type of donkey is no longer recognizable. Their sizes range from small standard which measures 36.01 to 40 inches, standard is 40.01 to 48 inches and the large standard measures 48.01 to 54 inches for females and up to 56 inches for male donkeys.

Cypriot Donkey
Despite what their name suggests, it is unclear as to where the Cypriot donkey first emerged. They are known for their more amiable personality and by their larger, floppier ears. They were first bred to work and even today, due to their work ethic, they are still used in some countries as working animals.

American Spotted Ass
The American Spotted Ass is strictly a donkey that is registered with the American Council of Spotted Asses (ACSA), a group that is interested in the preservation of this breed. All donkey breeds may have a spotted appearance but the American Spotted Ass is a donkey bred with another in the ACSA to keep the spotted trait.

                    <h3>Scientific Classification</h3>
                    <p>Donkeys are related to zebras and horses and are believed to be descended from Africa. They range in colors from gray (the most common), black, brown, white to strawberry. Though most of the domesticated donkeys are no longer pure breeds because of cross breeding there are still several breeds that are found throughout the world.

                        In their native arid and semi-arid climates, donkeys spend more than half of each day foraging and feeding, often on poor quality scrub. The donkey has a tough digestive system in which roughage is efficiently broken down by hind gut fermentation, microbial action in the caecum and large intestine. While there is no marked structural difference between the gastro-intestinal tract of a donkey and that of a horse, the digestion of the donkey is more efficient. It needs less food than a horse or pony of comparable height and weight, approximately 1.5 percent of body weight per day in dry matter, compared to the 2–2.5 percent consumption rate possible for a horse.<br/>Donkeys are also less prone to colic. The reasons for this difference are not fully understood; the donkey may have different intestinal flora to the horse, or a longer gut retention time. Donkeys obtain most of their energy from structural carbohydrates. Some suggest that a donkey needs to be fed only straw (preferably barley straw), supplemented with controlled grazing in the summer or hay in the winter, to get all the energy, protein, fat and vitamins it requires; others recommend some grain to be fed, particularly to working animals, and others advise against feeding straw. They do best when allowed to consume small amounts of food over long periods. They can meet their nutritional needs on 6 to 7 hours of grazing per day on average dryland pasture that is not stressed by drought. If they are worked long hours or do not have access to pasture, they require hay or a similar dried forage, with no more than a 1:4 ratio of legumes to grass. They also require salt and mineral supplements, and access to clean, fresh water. In a lush climate, donkeys are prone to obesity and are at risk of laminitis.<br/> Throughout the world, working donkeys are associated with the very poor, with those living at or below subsistence level. Few receive adequate food, and in general donkeys throughout the Third World are under-nourished and over-worked. In temperate climates the forage available is often too abundant and too rich; over-feeding may cause weight gain and obesity, and lead to metabolic disorders such as founder (laminitis) and hyperlipaemia, or to gastric ulcers.

                    <p class="text-justify">Donkeys vary considerably in size, depending on breed and management. The height at the withers ranges from 7.3 to 15.3 hands (31 to 63 inches, 79 to 160 cm), and the weight from 80 to 480 kg (180 to 1,060 lb). Working donkeys in the poorest countries have a life expectancy of 12 to 15 years; in more prosperous countries, they may have a lifespan of 30 to 50 years. Donkeys are adapted to marginal desert lands. Unlike wild and feral horses, wild donkeys in dry areas are solitary and do not form harems. Each adult donkey establishes a home range; breeding over a large area may be dominated by one jack. The loud call or bray of the donkey, which typically lasts for twenty seconds and can be heard for over three kilometres, may help keep in contact with other donkeys over the wide spaces of the desert. Donkeys have large ears, which may pick up more distant sounds, and may help cool the donkey's blood. Donkeys can defend themselves by biting, striking with the front hooves or kicking with the hind legs.</p>

The ancient asses, however, were discovered in southern and central Asia and northern Africa. In these areas they are well adapted to live in rocky highlands and low land deserts and prefer to live in warmer, dry climates.
                    Over time, the donkey become domesticated and migrated to all different parts of the world. In fact, Christopher Columbus brought four male donkeys and two females on his voyage to America. The mule offspring of these donkeys were even used by the Spanish in their conquests and still remain in these areas. Therefore, donkeys can be found in parts of Africa, Asia, Europe, the Americas, and even Australia.

Developing countries are home to over 90% of the donkey population. The largest numbers of working donkeys are found in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

                    Interesting Fact: Some species of donkeys, especially African and Asian donkeys, are very territorial. They will guard large territories of their habitat for years. In fact, some donkeys will only mate after they establish a territory.</p>
